# The Code of Christmas Past

This is a web application, created with [Chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice), that was used for the December 2023 Coding Night. It allows the user to get problem inputs and submit solutions to the problems for the first [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems of past years.
